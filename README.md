### Abstract
This project is about real-time vehicles detection using the YOLOv8s model for traffic monitoring. The system detects 6 types of vehicles: bus, truck, motorbike, bicycle, and person, in video frames with minimal delay. The model is trained on a dataset of over 5,800 augmented images, resized to 768Ã—768 pixels to ensure detection at further distances. Streamlink and OpenCV libraries are used to retrieve live videos from YouTube and handle video input and frame processing. A vehicle counter is used determine the street status (CROWDED or NOT) based on a predefined threshold (10 vehicles at a given frame). The model achieved a precision of 0.935, recall of 0.94, and mAP50 of 0.96, indicating strong performance. However, the limitation is lack of low-light and different weather conditions of the dataset.

### Some notes
- File ```./src/code/real_time_predict.py``` is used for predicting live videos YouTube (real-time detection).
- File ```./src/code/real_time_predict_multi.py``` is used for predicting many (3) live videos from YouTube at once, then it will show when/which video is currently showing CROWDED status.
